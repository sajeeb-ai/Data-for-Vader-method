VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text. Itâ€™s known for its ability to handle sentiment in informal and emotive language.

We collect public comments from various social media like X, Facebook and classify 3 different aspects like positive, negative, and neutral sentences based on different scenario. Our initial goal is using a Vader method which is a new inclusion in Matlab and check the accuracy of that model performance.
